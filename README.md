📂 Projects & Work Experience

Role/Project

Description

Onsite Technical Head — ERC 2025

Led the Mars Rover Manipal team onsite, implementing and overseeing the Agile framework. Coordinated rover development and technical submissions, supervising navigation, drone, and manipulator sub-sytems during the competition.

AI and Automation Engineer — Mars Rover Manipal

Developed core autonomy features: Trained a YOLOV8 model for arrow and cone detection ($>85\%$ accuracy). Designed and implemented a ROS2-based navigation stack (SLAM, waypoint planning, obstacle avoidance). Used ArUco tag pose estimation with OpenCV for high-precision localization. Integrated sensor data from ZED 2i stereo camera, IMU, and differential GPS with ROS2.

Autonomous Drone System

Developed an autonomous drone system on Cube Orange with Ardupilot, integrating DGPS and computer vision feedback for precision landing tasks.

Neural Network from Scratch

Built and trained a 3-layer Neural Network to achieve $91\%$ accuracy on the MNIST digit classification dataset. This included implementing custom layers, activation functions, and the training algorithm.

Synthetic Image Generation for Cybersecurity and ML

Developed a GAN-based framework for generating synthetic facial images to simulate age progression, enabling secure and privacy-preserving data augmentation for ML models in cybersecurity.

ECS Trainee Tasks (Trainee)

Developed embedded and vision projects: Real-time yellow ball detection with OpenCV, a PyQt GUI for IMU data visualization, and a socket-based interface for smartphone IMU data visualization in RViz for teleoperation training.
